## 💾 What the @#$% is this?

Welcome to **Retro Zero** - where we've resurrected gaming history with more love than your mom showed that Tamagotchi you starved to death in 1997.

This interactive museum showcases the evolution of gaming consoles from the primordial soup of the 1970s Magnavox Odyssey (aka "Wait, that's a game console?") to the sexy curves of the Sega CD. Each console comes lovingly documented with tech specs, notable games, and fun facts!

## 🎮 Features That'll Make You Go "MMmm"

- **Pokemon-Style Cards**: Each console gets its own collectible card with stats that would make Charizard jealous
- **Modal Detail Views**: Click any console to see its nerdy details in a beautiful overlay (because popups are back, baby!)
- **Theme Switching**: Toggle between three delicious viewing modes:
  - 🌞 **Light Mode**: Classic steampunk-inspired retro goodness
  - 🌙 **Dark Mode**: For night-time gaming nostalgia binges
  - 🔳 **High Contrast**: Because accessibility isn't just a buzzword (also good for those who are legally blind or using screens in direct sunlight)
- **Responsive AF**: Looks great on everything from your smart fridge to your grandmother's iPad
- **Keyboard Navigation**: For the mouse-haters among us

## 💻 Tech Stack

This digital shrine to pixelated nostalgia was crafted with:

- **HTML5**: Because we're not savages
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling that adapts faster than politicians during election season (side-eyeing you 'murica)
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks were harmed in the making of this site
- **Love**: And occasional sobbing over discontinued consoles

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo faster than a speedrunner beats Super Mario Bros:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/retro-zero.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser of choice 

3. Bask in the warm glow of nostalgia as you reminisce about blowing into cartridges

}
```

## 💔 Known Issues

- May cause uncontrollable nostalgia
- Could lead to eBay shopping sprees for vintage consoles
- The Game Boy survived a bombing in the Gulf War and still worked, but your feelings might not survive seeing how much your childhood collection would be worth if you hadn't let your mom donate it

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

- Shoutout to all the game developers who crafted our childhoods
- Respect to the terrible licensed games that taught us disappointment early in life
- One tear for all the forgotten consoles nobody remembers (pour one out for the Bandai Playdia)
